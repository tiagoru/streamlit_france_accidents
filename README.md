# Streamlit France Accidents app
### final version

Author: Tiago Russomanno

Streamlit interface for the final project at Datascientist, focusing on predicting car accidents in France.
## Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to predict the severity of road accidents in France based on historical data. This project encompasses all stages of a Data Science project, providing a comprehensive exploration of predictive modeling. The project workflow includes:

    Data Cleaning: Study and application of methods to clean the dataset, ensuring quality input for the predictive model.
    Feature Extraction: Extraction of relevant characteristics from historical data to estimate accident severity.
    Scoring of Risk Zones: Utilizing model results to score risk zones based on meteorological information, geographical location (GPS coordinates), satellite images, etc.
    Model Training: Development of a predictive model using machine learning techniques.
    Model Comparison: Comparison of the trained model's predictions with historical data.
